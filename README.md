# Google ADK Experiments & Mini-Projects

Welcome to my Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) learning repository. I use this space to build, test, and document my experiments with AI agents. 

I am a Sr. Data engineer with over a decade of experience building robust data pipelines. I am currently expanding my skills into AI Engineering. This repository showcases my hands-on journey from basic tool calling to complex multi-agent orchestration.

## About This Repository

This repository is a collection of isolated mini-projects. Each folder contains a specific agentic workflow or tool integration. The goal is to explore and create AI Agents using Google's ADK. 

You will find examples of custom Python tools, structured output configurations, and multi-agent delegation.
